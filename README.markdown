 _A Pen created at CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/zsofia-sz/pen/dyoXVvb](https://codepen.io/zsofia-sz/pen/dyoXVvb).
 
 In this exercise I am trying to imitate a simple online shop interface. 
 
 ##User stories
 User can view 10 products. 
 User can click on the "View item" and "Add to cart" buttons on each card.
 Upon clicking the "View item" button a modal window comes up with information on the product and the "Add to cart" button. Clicking on the modal will close the modal.
 Upon clicking the "Add to cart" button the product is added to the cart, and the number of total selected products is showing next to the cart. Clicking on the modal will close the modal.
 Upon clicking the cart a modal window is displayed that shows all selected product names, the total price, and the "Proceed to checkout" button.
